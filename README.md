# Snake and Ladder - JavaFX GUI Project

This is a Java FX-based graphical user interface (GUI) project that implements the classic Snake and Ladder game. It offers an interactive and engaging gaming experience for two players, offering clear turn-based gameplay with smooth transitions and visual feedback. The game is designed using JavaFX to create the user interface and Java for the game logic.

## Features

- A standard Snake and Ladder board is displayed with numbered squares.
- Two players can participate in the game, and they are denoted by different colored game pieces (solid circle).
- A "Start" button is present to initiate the game.
- The GUI displays whose turn it is, either "Player 1" or "Player 2."
- Only the player whose turn it is can make a move. The other player's turn button remains disabled during their opponent's turn.
- The game simulates rolling a dice with random values and displays the value on board.
- The player's game piece smoothly transitions from one square to another as they move on the board.
- The game continues until one of the players reaches square 100, at which point they are declared the winner.
- After a player wins, a "Restart" button appears, allowing players to reset the game and start a new round.
- The game provides visual feedback when players climb ladders, slide down snakes, or reach the win condition, ensuring players are informed of significant events.
